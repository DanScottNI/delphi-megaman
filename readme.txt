  Jackson for reporting this!

  weapon colour) in the palette editor.
- Added validation to the input boxes that are used in the scroll and room order 
  editors.
- Fixed the scroll editor code so that you can completely change the scroll. Thanks to
  Joe Doe for reporting the problems with the v1.0 release.
- Added a sprite change dialog box.
- Moved the Palettes and EnemyGFX directories to be located in the Data directory.
- Added a simple(r) scroll editor option.

5.  Whats to come... 
______________________________________________________________________________________

- General tidying up.
- Editing of the background changes that take place in Dr Wily #1's boss screen.
- Perhaps a combination of the room order editor and the scroll editor. It's just
  a matter of working out a half decent GUI.
- Bug fixes.
- More statistics to edit.
- Anything else I think of. (Or if anyone gives me some useful offsets to add new
  features)
